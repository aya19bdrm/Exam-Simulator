      "explanation": "Correct answer: Residual risk.\n\n- Why?\nResidual risk is the risk that remains after the response plan is implemented, i.e. it cannot be completely eliminated but is reduced to an acceptable level. Here, although paper forms are adopted as an alternative, there is a possibility that the changes will not be ready in time.\n\n- Why are the other options wrong?\n- A secondary risk is a new risk that arises as a result of taking action in response to the primary risk, and is not the case here.\n-  The primary risk is the original risk before the response plan was implemented.\n-  The risk of compliance is related to non-compliance with laws or regulations, which is not related here.",
